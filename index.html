            <p> I'm a recent graduate from Software Engineering from Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. I am passionate about UX/UI and that's why
                I started working on web development. However, when I was in high school I wanted to become a digital animator since I like
                to play videogames. But the career wasn't available at my campus, so I decided to be into the videogames industry by being a developer.
                Fortunately, life has many turns and twists and I realized it wasn't what I was expecting, so I decided to start looking into other
                technologies. And that's how I ended up with web development. :)
